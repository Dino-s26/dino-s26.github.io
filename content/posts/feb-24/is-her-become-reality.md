## Intermezzo

<p style='text-align: justify;'>

You guys remember there's movie called "HER", where the protagonis Theodore Twombly the introvert letter writer decide to buy OS1, an AI first OS
which somehow Theodore become attached to the AI. While he try to understand the AI (aka Samantha), he also going through divorce with his wife,
which is sad but somehow, day by day Theodore become attached to Samantha until one day Samantha become self aware and then it leave Theodore.

Now in reality (2024 Earth Year), we realize that Tech is growing so fast that we didn't even see what kind of tech is coming, it is just there.
Honestly I kind of scared at the moment with current Tech growth especially with AI stuff (aka Skynet, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rouge AI, etc),
but there's new company called 'rabbit', yes you hear it right.

TL;DR, The company is releasing companion device called "R1" which not phone, just companion device with it is own OS, now here's the summary
of what I learn from the product keynotes.

</p>

### LAM (Large Action Model)

Usually we hear about LLM, but for "Rabbit OS" they use term LAM (Large Action Model). In short, LAM more on how the OS will interact with various
of system interface, learn it, and also act like human to interaction with it, so it is not going to replace our current phone in general.

TL;DR, How LAM work are in 3 ways, Intention, Interface, Interact.

{{< figure src="/img/feb-24/is-her-become-reality/Lam-work.png" align=center >}}

1. **Intention**

By this mean LAM will try to understand what human perceiving so the LAM will need to learn from the prompt given by us.

2. **Interface**

By this mean LAM will learn our app interface, either it is android or ios, LAM will learn the interface of the app and get used to it to understand our prompt.

3. **Interact**

By this mean LAM will interact with us directly from the device, all we care wether the prompt we give is correct or not.

### Rabbit R1

In Brief R1, is not look like Phone or any other smart devices we usually see, but more like simplified version of handheld device, remind me of pager with limited functionality.

For Technical Specs can be seen [here](https://arc.net/l/quote/yqettbhd)

Diving deep to the R1 Companion device schematic, as we can see it is really compact and easily to be hold with 1 hand. 
Not much for a companion device, since the device itself will be activated by voice command, it really doesn't need to have bigger screen.

But there is a catch here, the LAM capability still limited in some cases as follows:

Since the Keynote Launch, Rabbit R1 is expected to be shipped in US/Canada by March/April 2024 other than that will be estimated later 2024.
Another catch here is that the Pre-order itself still limited to couples of country, even in Asia only Japan and South Korea havto e the privilege for the shipment, thought Singapore should be in the qualification but turn out it is not.

The biggest part where it is interesting is the Price of the device itself. As stated in the Keynote Launch by the CEO, Jesse Lyu, the price is $199 + taxes (+ shipping cost for international shipment) and without any subscription what so ever, interesting isn't ?.


### Key take way

Since the R1 companion device still in Pre-order phase, it will take while before we see it adopt by most of people around the world.
I kind of looking forward when they will open more shipment, especially Indonesia to do the hands-on and try their feature, also price wise it is still reachable for most of the people. Like it is stated in Keynotes, it ain't Phone or other smart devices, but more to companion device which we still need our phone for another purpose. Also, looking for what other use cases will it be possible, like block spam call, or we can do live translation for our call, or anything else.
