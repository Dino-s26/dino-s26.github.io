## Intermezzo

<div style='text-align: justify;'>

Henlo and Happy New Year 2024, I hope you guys in healthy condition and still have lots to achieve this year :grin:

So, actually long story short ...
I'm actually GCP person since 2018/2019, the first time I ever learn Cloud Tech and also getting my first certificate
in cloud, even tho it is still associate level lol. By that time I'm getting used to using GCP as my primary Cloud Stacks

Until recently I learn AWS Cloud Stack Tech, which way more simplified and also integration with their CLI tools more seamless, 
GCP CLI is not that bad, I just rarely use it, unlike AWS CLI since my work related to AWS Stacks

## The 'Why moving to AWS S3' 

even tho I realize that my bill for GCP Cloud Storage are around `~$50/month` with Indonesia Tax around 11% (used to 10%, 
since the changes with Indonesia Tax Rules in the past), this is way cheaper tbh for me, but there are couple of stuff makes me realize that I want to move to AWS S3 for some reasons (Which in this matter are subjective to my own oppinion):

1. AWS S3 can provide me with granular dashboard where I can see how much data I have, for comparison here's how the dashboard looks
